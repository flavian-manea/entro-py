%
% Compute the counts (i.e., histogram bins) from the "multiplicities"
% representation of a dataset

% INPUT: 
%    mm    - multiplicities (mm(j) is number of bins with icts(j) samples)
%    icts  - unique sample counts
%
% OUTPUT:
%    nn - nn(j) is the number of samples in the j'th (sorted) bin
