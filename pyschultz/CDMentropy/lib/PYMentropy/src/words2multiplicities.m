% INPUT: 
%   words - [Nwords x Ncells] matrix (each row is a word)
%   Nbase - [default: 2] Spike counts are considered digits in integer

% OUTPUT: 
%       mm - multiplicities (mm(j) is number of bins with icts(j) samples)
%            note: mm is sorted so that mm(j) >= mm(j+1)
%     icts - unique sample counts
%       nn - sorted count of word frequencies
%      bin - [Ncellsx1] vector mapping word to its index in nn
%
% CAUTION: double can take up to 51 bits, but will break down after that!
