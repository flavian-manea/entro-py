% Return unique integer symbols representing spike-time occurence 
% sequences in spike times from multiple cells.
% 
% INPUT: 
%   sptimes - [Ncells x1] cell array of spike times 
%        dt - [1x1] length of bins in times ( #bins will be T/dt)
%         T - [1x1] length of spike time recording 
%               * When T is empty (T = []), T is the maximum time
%                 occurring in sptimes. 
%     Nbase - [default: 2] Spike counts are considered
%             digits in integer system of 
%             base Nbase, with a binary system assumed by
%             default. Any spike count > (Nbase-1) is set to 
%             (Nbase - 1);
% OUTPUT: 
%       mm - multiplicities (mm(j) is number of bins with icts(j) samples)
%            * mm is sorted so that mm(j) >= mm(j+1)
%     icts - unique sample counts
%  wordvec - [T/dt x 1] vector of integer words (ie, the word wordvec(i) 
%            occurrs at time i).
